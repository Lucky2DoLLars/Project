# Statistical-Model

## Introduction
In this repository, we focus on the implementation of statistical model by R-code.
There are a wide variety of statistical models from linear regression model which is very simple to neural network model which is very complicated.
Implementing statistical model will be very good for us to understand model, esepcially computer intensive method such as KNN(K-nearest neighbor).
